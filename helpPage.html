  <h2>Create an Equation</h2>
  <p class="indentText">
  To create an image out of your equation, first select the math equation format of your choice (Ex latex,MathML,Ascii). Then type your equation inside the text box. As you're typing youâ€™ll see a preview image of what your image will look like.. Once you are done hit the submit button and it will create an image of the equation.  Just a note as you  are typing the preview will always be very small and black no matter what your settings.  This is to increase usability with a small ui.
  </p>

  <h2>Copy Button</h2>
  <p class="indentText">will move the create equation onto the slideshow</p>


  <h2>bind Button</h2>

  <h2>unbind button</h2>
  <p class="indentText">This button will unbind the equation to the UI.  So when you hit the copy button it will add a new image</p>
